#+TITLE: Regit

* Overview

Git-replay is a simple tool that /replays/ the history
of a Git repository but with some tweaks (i.e., it can
change the author name and email).

* Usage

#+begin_src sh
cargo run -- <src repo> <dest dir> <name> <email>
#+end_src

Then, a clone repository with updated name and email is
crated under ~<dest dir>~.

* Limitations

Limited to repositories with /linear/ commit history
(i.e., can't handle merge).
